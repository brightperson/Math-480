This is the repository for the Math 480 Summer 2024 course. Assignments will be posted in this repository under the appropriate folder.

## Guidelines
You are highly encouraged to look up external resources for help. This includes sources for understanding the mathematics behind the assignment and also for learning any Python specifics.

You **are** allowed (and encouraged!) to use AI coding assistants. The recommended AI tools for this course are [Codeium](https://codeium.com) for autocomplete and [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) as a search engine.

You **are not** allowed to copy and paste code from other students in the class or from websites. Code generated by AI tools is allowed.

## Submission Process
1. Fork this repository into your own account.
2. Create a new branch for each assignment and title the branch with the assignment date.
3. Implement the assignment and push your code to GitHub so that it is timestamped. Your final submission commit should have the tag `[SUBMISSION]` in the commit message.

# Solutions
For each assignment, solutions will be posted under a branch with the corresponding name of the day and assignment. You can clone this repository and checkout the solution branches if you want to experiment with the code locally, or you can view them on GitHub by selecting the appropriate branch.
