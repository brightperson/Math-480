# Parenthesizations Pytorch
In this assignment, you will learn to train a very simple model for predicting whether a given parenthesization is valid or not. The model we will use has a single linear layer and is, in a sense, the simplest model you could possibly train. Nevertheless, you'll see that we can get good accuracy (>90%). Training such a simple model has two advantages. One, it is an easy introduction to learning how to use Pytorch for machine learning. Two, it makes interpreting the model easier.

Your goal in this assignment will be to first generate appropriate datasets for the parenthesizations. The mathematical logic is already implemented for you in `parenthesizations.py` but you will need to edit `data.py` and `generate_data.ipynb`. Next, you'll implement `train_one_epoch` and `evaluate_model` in `train.py`. Finally, you'll walk through the `main.ipynb` notebook to set up and train your model and then analyze the results. The resulting model will have a very simple rule that you can interpret and you will "translate" that simple rule into an equivalent Python function.
